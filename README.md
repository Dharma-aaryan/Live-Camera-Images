# Live-Camera-Images
A simple Python based code for capturing live images of something/someone in front of the camera 

to run the code in IDLE using command prompt
1.) locate this code file 
  a.) for python version 3.8 and below
    type = cd desktop -> cd 'file location'-> python filename.py 
  b.) for python version 3.9 and above
    type = cd desktop -> cd 'file location'-> py filename.py 

So this code is basically a simple implementation of python. We access the camera of the device using this code and it captures real time images and stores them in temorary memory of the device; on pressing 'q' , it will give the recent real time image. On continuosuly pressing 'q' we will get multiple real time images and this in turn will show like its playing a video. to exit this simply press 'space'; if this doesnt work then just close the command prompt.
